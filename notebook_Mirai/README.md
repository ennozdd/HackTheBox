# Quick Summary

Miray is an easy linux box. I really like the box because it is fun and straigtforward. There is no rabbitholes. There is a couple of clues telling us that it is an embbeded network device. Once we realize it is a raspberry pi everything gets so much easier. Raspberry pi by default exposes ssh with default credentials and this setup gets us into the box. For the root part, the flag is deleted from file system but it is easy to restore as long as you understand what deleted file means.
